Rule 1 – Folder Structure
Maintain a clear folder structure:
- components/ or widgets/ → reusable UI pieces
- services/ → API, DB, Firebase logic
- state/ or bloc/ → state management
- models/ → data models
- utils/ → helper functions
Keep files small and focused on one responsibility.

Rule 2 – Consistency in State Management
Use the same state management approach across the project (Bloc, Provider, or Riverpod).  
Do not mix multiple patterns in one project.  

Rule 3 – Code Cleanup
Remove unused imports, dead code, and commented-out blocks.  
Identify outdated files and either refactor or delete them.  

Rule 4 – Documentation & Comments
Document complex logic with short comments or JSDoc/Dartdoc style.  
Avoid obvious comments like “increment by 1”.
